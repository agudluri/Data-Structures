- 'Graph.java' is the primary graph class containing the requisite methods for the Spanning Tree to work.

- 'PQ.java' is an implementation of a Minimum Heap (using a Priority Queue), that would be used in Graph.java. This class is cruicial for the entire process.

- 'Prim.java' is the main class required to read the input and call the Spanning Tree functions.

- A sample input, 'input.txt' has been provided with the edge information of the graph in the form of a matrix. You may edit the weights as you please.
